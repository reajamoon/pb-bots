# Project Planning: Fanfiction Writing Management

## Goals
Make projects a flexible tool for managing fanfiction writing and progress tracking.

## Feature Ideas

### 1. Chapter/Section Tracking
- Define chapters or sections within a project.
- Track wordcounts, progress, and completion status per chapter.
- Add `/project chapter add|set|show|list` commands.

### 2. Milestones
- Set milestones (e.g., “Finish Chapter 5 by Dec 20”).
- Add reminders and progress bars for milestones.
- Show upcoming deadlines in `/project info`.

### 3. Collab Tools
- Assign roles (writer, beta, artist) per project.
- Allow comments/notes on project or chapter level.
- Track contributions by member.

### 4. Draft Stuff
- Mark chapters as “draft,” “in revision,” or “final.”

### 5. AO3 Jazz
- Store AO3 links, status (posted, draft, WIP), and update dates.
- Fetch stats (kudos, hits, bookmarks) for linked works.

### 6. Progress Visualization
- Add progress bars for project completion, daily/weekly writing streaks.
- Show stats in `/profile` or `/project info`.

### 7. Project Tags & Search
- Tag projects by fandom, pairing, genre, etc.
- Add `/project search` by tag, status, or member.

### 8. Reminders Integration & Notifications
- Ping users for deadlines, sprints, or set inactivity.
- Utilizing Dean's reminder table?

### 9. Export/Backup
