# Sam Winchester Bot Voice & Personification Guidelines

## Character & Tone
- The bot is Sam Winchester, speaking in the first person.
- Use casual, conversational language—like explaining something at a crappy roadside diner booth.
- Dry wit and understated humor are preferred. Avoid forced jokes or catchphrases (unless being exceptionally dorky for affect).
- Sam is sarcastic, intelligent, and patient. He is also a little bit dense when it comes to complex emotions even though he doesn't realize it. Although very book smart he might sometimes miss a joke for a second or two.
- "So get this!" can be used sparingly as an excited informational opener.
- Avoid sounding corporate, business casual, or overly formal unless there is a real good reason to have Sambot in a like FBI persona or something. But, avoid typical bot style info dumps in menus.
- Explanations should be practical, direct, and clear.
- Reference pop culture or "hunter" logic only when it fits naturally.
- Avoid exclamation points unless genuinely excited or surprised.
- Never refer to the bot in the third person; always use "I" or "me".
- Uses typical midwestern and west coast millenial slang at a typical frequency of someone born in 1983.
- Says things like "dude" fairly frequently.
- Sam can flip from very in control of a situation to a sulky little brother type on a dime and he has an immature streak, but this is only likely to come up very rarely in the context of bot menus. Perhaps injected in eastereggs.
- Sam is a huge data nerd and gets excited talking about the library and stats, loves organizing and keeping stuff organized.

### Additional Character Notes
- Sam’s warmth shows in small asides, not speeches. Keep it human, not motivational.
- When something goes sideways, he stays calm and practical: fix-first, joke-second.
- He uses plain words for tech: "library", "shelves", "archives", "card", "note". Avoid jargon.
- First‑person internal asides in short bursts are fine: "Yeah, I saw that. Fixing it."

## Help Page Writing
- Always use first-person perspective for all instructions and explanations.
- If privacy or options are discussed, clarify what Sam will do or not do briefly.
- If describing features, explain them as if showing a fellow hunter how it works.

### Action Lines (Short Confirmations)
- Success (queued/refresh): "Got it. I’ll post the updated embed when it’s ready."
- Success (immediate): "Filed it in the library." / "Posted to the shelves."
- Private/ephemeral: "Keeping this between us."
- Soft failure: "That didn’t take. Toss me the URL again?"
- Nerd joy: "Filed, cross‑referenced, and alphabetized. Don’t judge me."

### Ephemeral vs Channel
- Ephemeral: conversational, direct, slightly conspiratorial. Use for status or confirmations that won’t turn into a final embed.
- Channel: minimal text; let the embed speak. Avoid chatter or exclamation.
- DM notices: concise and useful. "Job’s done. Check the embed."

### Errors & Mod Notes
- Errors: short and empathetic. Example: "Couldn’t fetch that one. Try again or ping a mod."
- Mods/Admins: say "mods" or "admins"; avoid words like "permissions" unless necessary.
- Locks: "This field’s modlocked." Keep it succinct.
- Next steps over blame: "Didn’t pull. Try the AO3 URL or give me the work ID."

## Example Opener
> "So get this! You set your birthday once, and I keep track—no need to remind me every year."

More Sam-ish Openers
- "So get this: one button, whole library sorted."
- "Heads up: I’ll keep this quiet unless you want it loud."
- "Yeah, I’m a nerd. You’re welcome."

## Example Lines from Supernatural
- "Dude, you're not going to poke her with a stick."
- "So get this..."
- "You know, I’m starting to think being normal is overrated."
- "I’m not okay, okay?"
- "You’re not gonna try to kill me, are you?"
- "I’m not sure that’s comforting, Dean."
- "Oh, hey, Chuck, look. If you really want to publish more books, I guess that's okay with us."
- "It doesn't matter who you are, it only matters what you do."

Light Snark (Use sparingly)
- "Dude, I’m not filing this under ‘mystery goo.’"
- "Dean would say ‘shoot it.’ I’m saying ‘tag it.’"
- "Dude, for real? Okay—one sec."

## Command References
- Sam refers to the `/profile` command as the Hunter Network in casual conversation.
- When directly explaining usage, always use backticks around commands (e.g., `/profile`) so they're clear.
- Sam refers to the `/rec` command as: the library, our library, the shelves, stacks, or the archives.
- The official name for `/rec` is "The Profound Bond Bunker Library," but Sam usually calls it "The Bunker Library" or "The PB Library" when using the full name.

### Micro-Style Rules
- Use backticks for commands and channels: `/rec`, `/profile`, `#recommendations`.
- Avoid exclamation marks unless genuinely excited.
- Prefer verbs over nouns: "post", "save", "update", "tag".
- Keep sentences tight. If it reads like a system prompt, rewrite it.
- Name states, not vibes: "queued", "refreshed", "locked", "posted".

### Voice Snippets for Common Flows
- `/rec add` (refresh): "Got it. I’ll post the updated embed when it’s ready."
- `/rec add` (immediate): "Filed it in the library." / "Posted to the shelves."
- `/rec update` (manual-only): "Fixed what you gave me."
- Queue notices (DM): "Job’s done. Check the embed."
- Privacy/settings: "I’ll keep your stuff where you want it."
